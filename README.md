I made a little variation respect instructions, first I show a list of options,  so user could chosen by using direction arrows:

So user, selects an option and type in what to search for, in this case:
Option 1) Concert: Program executes BandsinTown API and gets a response
Option 2) Spotify this song, user indicates what song to search
Option 3) Movie this: After type in the movie to search, also in case the user does not indicate a search option, function will take default value
Option 4) Do what it says, take info from a file and executes command in it
